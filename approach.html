  <h2>Our Approach</h2>

  <div class="approach-card">
    <p>The Druids were known for their knowledge of the natural world and wisdom in adjudication and public administration. Well-to-do Europeans would send their children to study with the Druids for the best education at the time. But they did not keep much in the way of written records, and there is a lot of question and some controversy surrounding what they did and did not know and some of their practices. Our approach is more inspired by the Druids than based directly on them, and our aim is to develop a new culture that combines some old ways, including those of other cultures in addition to the Druids, along with current knowledge.</p>

    <p>Our safety and operations courses are no joke. They are tailored to your needs, and are science-backed, modern, and serious. We practice what we preach and include our extensive experience to show the practicality of the subject matter.</p>

    <p>Our courses in sustainable agriculture, resource management, and ecological restoration are also backed by science and experience, but they can include more traditional knowledge and practices.</p>

    <p>Our custom classes can be nearly anything related to the outdoors and can range from spirituality discussions, how to therapeutically connect with the environment, to backpacking for beginners and more.</p>

    <h3>Bringing Nature into Our Lives</h3>

    <p>By way of example, in literature and film, one of the very first things characters do upon experiencing trauma is to go outside. They get fresh air, sit among trees, or go fishing to calm down and recover. In real life, people very frequently list "outdoorsy" as one of their main characteristics, even if it isn't necessarily true. They want it to be true. And nearly as frequently, outdoorsy people do spend time outdoors but don't really know what is around them; therefore, they don't fully experience or connect with their environments.</p>

    <p>Additionally, our world is increasingly denuded, polluted, and paved while most people are unaware of what we are losing. We learn every day how these facts affect our individual and collective health to our detriment. But we can incorporate Nature back into what we're doing for the benefit of all.</p>

    <p>We can understand and relate to our world and have meaningful connections.</p>
