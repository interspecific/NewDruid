  <h3>Praise for the New Druid Institute</h3>

    <h4>Sam E.</h4>
    <p>Jeremy has a way of presenting topics in a way that's enlightening, educational, but also graspable. Anyone can present instructions to a group of people, drone of facts, and give examples, but a real instructor leaves students with something more than just knowledge. A real instructor leaves students with confidence. Jeremy took topics that I had minimal exposure to and made it so that I could confidently call my new skills work capabilities--skills I will have for the rest of my life.</p>
    <p><strong>Courses taken:</strong> Prescribed Fire Training, Equipment Operation, Chainsaw Safety and Tree Felling, Adult First Aid/CPR/AED Certification, Eco Leadership, Driving a Large Truck and Trailer</p>

    <h4>Ian F.</h4>
    <p>Jeremy's classes are very informative. You can ask him to identify any plant, and he will know it, along with habitat management recommendations. He's also a professional badass with a chainsaw and will show you proper, safe use of one.</p>

    <p>I've been CPR Certified for years, but I've never felt so comfortable with the material and techniques after a class before.</p>

    <h4>Joel B.</h4>
    <p>I had the pleasure of working closely with Jeremy with my previous employer. Jeremy has an exceptional ability to interpret and illustrate the systems and processes that were critical to understanding my role. His training and management style brought a sense of empowerment and ease to my transition as I assumed greater responsibility within that company.</p>
    <p>Jeremy shows a strong proficiency in methods for training and educating staff. I believe those who have the opportunity to work with him will find qualities that inspire their own professional development through his example.</p>

    <h4>Ben G.</h4>
    <p>Having Jeremy on the team to oversee our prescribed burn, ecological restoration, truck/trailer, and heavy equipment training was a welcome relief due to the experience and integrity that he brought. Jeremy has years of environmental consulting experience, provides a thoughtful approach to training, and is a dependable person to work with.</p>
