  <h2>Cancellation and Refund Policies</h2>

  <p>Cancellations for refunds for class registrations will only be given with at least 48 hours prior written request by the participant. No refunds will be issued with less than 48 hours notice.</p>

  <p>Participants may reschedule and apply paid registration fees to a different session of the same class up to 24 hours prior to the original class with written notice to the New Druid Institute.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, some participants do not pass a course. In that case, the participant will not be certified, and their registration fee will not be refunded. New Druid Institute, LLC also reserves the right to refuse or discontinue service for disruptive participants or other reasons and will not issue refunds in those cases.</p>

  <p>Refunds for other services will only occur under limited special circumstances with written communication to the New Druid Institute and are at the discretion of the owner.</p>
